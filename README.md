# nlHP

Random NLP tasks with Harry Potter text.  Probably written in python... might use R for more nostalgia and for Harry Pot-R pun potential.

Data gathered from the [formcept/whiteboard GitHub repo](https://github.com/formcept/whiteboard/tree/master/nbviewer/notebooks/data/harrypotter) (tbh, not sure legality of the whole thing, so the data directory is excluded from the repo to avoid redistributing any potentially legally sketchy stuff).
